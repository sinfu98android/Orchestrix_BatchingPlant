A lightweight industrial orchestration module for batching automation, real-time analytics, and direct PLC integration. Designed for high-speed, low-latency environments without requiring middleware servers or OPC bridges.<br>
**Designed and developed the Orchestrix software framework entirely from scratch**. Applied it to a refurbished batching plant, collaborating with the operator and their staff for system integration, commissioning, and performance optimization<br>

•	Database: MySQL <br>
•	Deployment: FTP (WinSCP – legacy industrial environments) <br>


### 🚀 Batching Plant Features 
**Core Features** <br>
•	ERP → Automatic batching job creation <br>
•	Real-time ingredient weighing <br>
•	Automatic sequence control (mixing, dosing, loading) <br>
•	Load cell amplifier integration <br>
•	Remote I/O & PLC command execution <br>
•	Real-time runtime logging <br>
•	Event monitoring + alarms <br>
•	Full traceability (batch history) <br>

**Operational Features** <br>
•	Multi-plant centralized web control <br>
•	1 operator can run multiple batching lines <br>
•	Remote troubleshooting & maintenance <br>
•	Brand-agnostic hardware support <br>
•	Very lightweight (no middleware bridge needed) <br>


### ⚡ Performance & Impact <br> 
•	2+ years continuous operation in real industrial environment <br>
•	Reduced downtime via predictive maintenance <br>
•	OEE insights for cycle time, machine utilization, quality <br>
•	Faster troubleshooting with centralized logs <br>

### 🏭 Field Deployment

The batching plant automation system is powered by the **Orchestrix Framework**, providing deterministic, middleware-free control and HMI.  

This **panel** represents the heart of the system, installed in the field and used in production. It demonstrates:

- Real industrial deployment  
- Integration of HMI, PLC logic, and Orchestrix orchestration  
- Reliable, long-term operation in a factory environment
